# Taxi-demand-prediction-analysis
Our main objective is to predict number of pickups, given location co-ordinates (latitude and longitude) and time, in the query region and surrounding regions. And to solve this we would be using data collected in Jan 2015 to predict the pickups in Jan - Mar 2016. Main attraction of this project was use Fourier transform as feature. We have chosen our error metric for comparison between models as MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) so that we can know that on an average how good is our model with predictions
